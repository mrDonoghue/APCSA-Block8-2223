## Warmup
* If you don't have working *code* in the [ZeroOrOne repl](https://replit.com/team/APCSA-Block8-2223/ZeroOrOne), try to write the code!
* If you do have working code, try to fix the *formatting* and *readability* of the code
* If you've already finished both of those, you're probably ahead of the curve. You'll need a side project soon. Start brainstorming some side projects
    - maybe start by making the ZeroOrOne program better?
    - maybe some little specialized calculator/tracker to help you with a common task?
    - maybe a basic text-based game?
