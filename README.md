## Warmup
* Open up [WritingClasses](https://replit.com/team/APCSA-Block8-2223/WritingClasses)
* In `Person.java` add an instance variable to represent how much money a `Person` is currently carrying with them
* In `Person.java` add a method called `getMoney()` that returns how much money the `Person` is currently carrying

## Today
