# Lab 1: Bibliophile
In this lab we'll practice using a class we haven't used before. You can read the code in `Book.java` and look for the
constructor headers and method headers to get a sense for how you might use them. 
You might also look at the comment before each method/constructor for
more information.

## Requirements
    - Finish the `addRating` method in `Book.java`
    - Create at least 4 different book objects, storing a reference to each objet in a variable. Use each of the 2 constructors at least once.
    - Give each book at least 1 rating using the addRatings method (ratings should be between 0 and 5 stars)
    - Print out all the information for each book in a neatly formatted manner using String concatenation (+)
    and the methods of the Book class

## Bonus Challenges
    - Make your own class to represent some relatively simple category of thing.
